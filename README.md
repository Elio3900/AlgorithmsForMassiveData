# AlgorithmsForMassiveData
This repository contains Colab notebooks from Algorithms for Massive Data course at univeristy of Milan.
It contains both notebooks from laboratories and final project about ocular disease recognition. 

Files description: 

CIFAR_CNN_CLASSIFICATION.ipynb, FOREST_COVER_PREDICTION.ipynb, MPG_PREDICTION.ipynb are notebooks from laboratories. This code was 
patrially reused for the puroposes of the final project.

OCULAR_DISEASE_PREPROCESSING.ipynb - data preprocessing, resizing and creating validation set, by randomly taking 30% of images.

OCULAR_DISEASE_AUGMENTATION.ipynb - oversampling minority classes, by augmenting their images applying random zoom, rotations etc.

OCULAR_DISEASE_RECOGNITION.ipynb - training final model.

Other files contain several other experiments ( moslty training on smaller dataset), all details on that are provided in the final report.
